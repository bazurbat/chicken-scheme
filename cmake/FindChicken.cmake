#    use it to generate C files which are built by a cross-compiler - set host
#    system to the identifier of the cross chicken
# More complex combinations are possible. Specifically: source files are
# generated for the target system, using the host system Chicken and built
# by system cross-compiler (linked with its libchicken).
