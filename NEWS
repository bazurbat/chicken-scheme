  `chicken-install' now allows aliases for locations
- CHICKEN systems build from cross-compilation now by default 
  transparently build and install extensions for both the host
  and target parts of the cross-compilation setup; the options
  `-host' and `-target' can now be used to selectively build
  an extensions for the host- and the target system, respectively

- the reader signals an error when a file contains certain characters
  that indicate that it is a binary file
- procedure-information shown by the printer for procedures is now
  corrected for some library procedures that where missing the correct
  information; `getter-with-setter' copies procedure-information objects
  into the newly created accessor procedure, if available
- calls to some known pure standard- or extended procedures are removed, if
  the procedures are called with side-effect free arguments and the
  result is not used (this can also by enabled for user procedures with

  output instead of throwing an error to avoid endless recursion when
  an error message is printed
- a feature identifier named `chicken-MAJOR.MINOR' is now defined 
  to simplify conditionalization of code on the CHICKEN version
- `getter-with-setter' copies the lambda-information (if available) from
  the getter to the generated procedure

- added the `safe-globals' declaration specifier
- split up manual chapter `Modules and macros' into two chapters
  (named `Modules' and `Macros', respectively - suggested by
  Mario Goulart)

  option and declaration
- usage of unimported syntax in modules gives more usable
  error messages; in particular, used but unimported FFI forms are 
  now detected
- invalid syntactic forms (mostly `()') encountered by the compiler
  or interpreter show the contextual form containing the expression,
  or, if indicated by the context warns about missing imports
- simplified manual pages of all core tools - they now refer to
  the output shown by invoking `<tool> -help'

  evaluation order of the arguments and does a better job
  at detecting non-list arguments (thanks to Jim Ursetto)
- `void' now takes arbitrary arguments and ignores them
- deprecated `noop' (from the `data-structures' unit) which
  is now replaced by `void'
- the `time' macro now performs a major garbage collection
  before executing the contained expressions and writes
  the timings in a more compact format to the port given
  by `(current-error-port)' instead of the standard output
  port
- definitions of the form `(define define ...)' and
  `(define-syntax define-syntax ...)' now trigger an error,
  as required by R5RS (thanks to Jeronimo Pellegrini and Alex
  Shinn)

  is identical to `randomize'
- added new procedure `create-temporary-directory' to the
  `files' unit

  in combination with `-t local'
- added new option `-deploy' to `chicken-install', which builds
  extension for use in "deployed" applications (see below)

  and double-clickable Macintosh GUI apps; see the "Deployment"
  manual chapter for more information
- the directory given to the `-prefix' option of `chicken-install'
  may now be a relative pathname.
- removed GUI-specific runtime library (`libchicken-gui') from

  with an internal form and syntax to allow renaming and shadowing of
  these forms
- the new `-private-repository' option in `csc' compiles executables

  libraries are not binary-compatible with previous releases; this
  means all eggs have to be reinstalled and existing programs be
  recompiled!
- added unboxing pass to compiler which results in partially dramatical
  performance improvements for unsafe floating-point-intensive code;
  unboxing is enabled on optimization levels 4 and 5
- removed rest-argument-vector optimization as it could conflict
  with inlining (thanks to Sven Hartrumpf)

  rules in some cases)
- it is now possible to pass a config-file to `make(1)' instead of specifying
  all build-options as variables on the command-line (see README)

- the pretty-printer prints the end-of-file object readably now
- alternative conditional execution paths have separate allocation computation
  (previously the allocation of all alternatives was coalesced)
- removed unused "%kmp-search" from "srfi-13" library unit
- expander handles syntax-reexports and makes unexported syntax available
  for exported expanders in import libraries
- added checks in some procedures in the "tcp" library unit
- the macro system has been completely overhauled and converted 
  to hygienic macros
- a macro-aware module system has been added
- added "-sx" option to csi
- removed the following deprecated functions:
   [un]shift!
   andmap ormap
   byte-vector? byte-vector-fill!
   make-byte-vector byte-vector
   byte-vector-set! byte-vector-ref 
   byte-vector->list list->byte-vector
   string->byte-vector byte-vector->string
   byte-vector-length
   make-static-byte-vector static-byte-vector->pointer
   byte-vector-move! byte-vector-append!
   set-file-position! set-user-id! set-group-id!
   set-process-group-id!
   macro? undefine-macro!
- the situation-identifiers "run-time" and "compile-time" have
  been removed
- the compiler options "-check-imports", "-import" and "-emit-exports"
  have been removed
- new procedures:
  strip-syntax
  expand
- new macros
  define-syntax
  module
  export
- the following macros have been removed:
    define-foreign-record
    define-foreign-enum
    define-macro
    define-extension
- "local" mode, in which locally defined exported toplevel variables can
  be inlined
- new options and declarations "[-]local", "[-]inline-global" and "-emit-inline-file"
- optimization levels changed to use inlining:
  -optimize-level 3: enables -inline -local (but *not* -unsafe)
  -optimize-level 4: enables -inline -local -unsafe
- increased default inlining-limit to 20
- support for cross-module inlining
- "make <VARIABLES> bench" runs the benchmark suite
- "chicken-setup" has been replaced by new command line tools
  "chicken-install", "chicken-uninstall" and "chicken-status", which are
  more flexible and allow greater freedom when creating local or application-
  specific repositories
- extension-installation can be done directly from SVN repositories or a local
  file tree
- enabled chicken mirror site as alternative download location
