=== Types

A dynamically typed language like Scheme does not restrict the type of
values bound or assigned to variables to be constant troughout the
run-time of a program. This provides a lot of flexibility and makes it
easy to get code up and running quickly, but can make maintenance of
larger code bases more difficult as the implicit assignment of types
to variables done by the programmer has to be "recovered" when the
code is inspected or debugged again. Statically typed languages
enforce distinct types for all variables, optionally providing
type-inference to compute types without requiring the user to specify
explicit type declarations in many cases.

If the compiler has some knowledge of the types of local or global
variables then it can help in catching type-related errors like
passing a value of the wrong type to a user-defined or built-in
procedure. Type-information also can be used to generate more
efficient code by omitting unnecessary type-checks.

CHICKEN provides an intra-procedural flow-analysis pass and two
compiler options for using type-information in this manner:

{{-specialize}} will replace certain generic library procedure calls
with faster type-specific operations.

{{-strict-types}} makes type-analysis more optimistic and gives
more opportunities for specialization, but may result in unsafe
code if type-declarations are violated.

Note that the interpreter will always ignore type-declarations
and will not perform any flow-analysis of interpreted code.


==== Declaring types

Type information for all core library units is available by default.
User-defined global variables can be declared to have a type using
the {{(declare (type ...))}} or {{:}} syntax.


===== :

<syntax>(: IDENTIFIER TYPE)</syntax>

Declares that the global variable {{IDENTIFIER}} is of the given type.


===== the

<syntax>(the TYPE EXPRESSION)</syntax>

Equivalent to {{EXPRESSION}}, but declares that the result will be of the
given type. Note that this form always declares the type of a single result,
{{the}} can not be used to declare types for multiple result values. {{TYPE}}
should be a subtype of the type inferred for {{EXPRESSION}}, the compiler
will issue a warning if this should not be the case.


===== assume

<syntax>(assume ((VARIABLE TYPE) ...) BODY ...)</syntax>

Declares that at the start of execution of {{BODY ..}}, the variables will
be of the given types. This is equivalent to

<enscript hightlight=scheme>
(let ((VARIABLE (the TYPE VARIABLE)) ...) 
  BODY ...)
</enscript>


===== define-type

<syntax>(define-type NAME TYPE)</syntax>

Defines a type-abbreviation {{NAME}} that can be used in place of
{{TYPE}}.  Type-abbreviations defined inside a module are not visible
outside of that module.


==== Type syntax

Types declared with the {{type}} declaration (see [[Declarations]])
or {{:}} should follow the syntax given below:

<table>
<tr><th>TYPE</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{deprecated}}</td><td>any use of this variable will generate a warning</td></tr>
<tr><td>VALUETYPE</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<table>  
<tr><th>VALUETYPE</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{(or VALUETYPE ...)}}</td><td>"union" or "sum" type</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(not VALUETYPE)}}</td><td>non-matching type (*)</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(struct STRUCTURENAME)}}</td><td>record structure of given kind</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(procedure [NAME] (VALUETYPE ... [#!optional VALUETYPE ...] [#!rest [VALUETYPE]]) . RESULTS)}}</td><td>procedure type, optionally with name</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(VALUETYPE ... [#!optional VALUETYPE ...] [#!rest [VALUETYPE]] -> . RESULTS)}}</td><td>alternative procedure type syntax</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(VALUETYPE ... [#!optional VALUETYPE ...] [#!rest [VALUETYPE]] --> . RESULTS)}}</td><td>procedure type that is declared to modify locally held state</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(VALUETYPE -> VALUETYPE : VALUETYPE)}}</td><td>predicate procedure type</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(forall (TYPEVAR ...) VALUETYPE)}}</td><td>polymorphic type</td></tr>
<tr><td>COMPLEXTYPE</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BASICTYPE</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>TYPEVAR</td><td>{{VARIABLE}} or {{(VARIABLE TYPE)}}</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><th>BASICTYPE</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{*}}</td><td>any value</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{blob}}</td><td>byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{boolean}}</td><td>boolean</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{char}}</td><td>character</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{eof}}</td><td>end-of-file object</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{fixnum}}</td><td>word-sized integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{float}}</td><td>floating-point number</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{list}}</td><td>null or pair</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{locative}}</td><td>locative object</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{null}}</td><td>empty list</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{number}}</td><td>fixnum or float</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{pair}}</td><td>pair</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{pointer-vector}}</td><td>vector or native pointers</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{pointer}}</td><td>native pointer</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{input-port}} {{output-port}}</td><td>input- or output-port</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{procedure}}</td><td>unspecific procedure</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{string}}</td><td>string</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{symbol}}</td><td>symbol</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{vector}}</td><td>vector</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><th>COMPLEXTYPE</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{(pair TYPE1 TYPE2)}}</td><td>pair with given component types</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(list-of TYPE)}}</td><td>proper list with given element type</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(list TYPE1 ...)}}</td><td>proper list with given length and element types</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(vector-of TYPE)}}</td><td>vector with given element types</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(vector TYPE1 ...)}}</td><td>vector with given length and element types</td></tr>
</table>

<table>  
<tr><th>RESULTS</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{*}}</td><td>any number of unspecific results</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{(RESULTTYPE ...)}}</td><td>specific number of results with given types</td></tr>
</table>

<table>  
<tr><th>RESULTTYPE</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{undefined}}</td><td>a single undefined result</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{noreturn}}</td><td>procedure does not return normally</td></tr>
<tr><td>VALUETYPE</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

(*) Note: no type-variables are bound inside {{(not TYPE)}}.

Note that type-variables in {{forall}} types may be given "constraint" types, i.e.

  (: sort (forall (e (s (or (vector-of e) (list-of e))))
            (s (e e -> *) -> s)))

declares that {{sort}} is a procedure of two arguments, the first
being a vector or list of an undetermined element type {{e}} and the
second being a procedure that takes two arguments of the element type.
The result of {{sort}} is of the same type as the first argument.

Some types are internally represented as structure types, but you can also use
these names directly in type-specifications - {{TYPE}} corresponds to
{{(struct TYPE)}} in this case:

<table>  
<tr><th>Structure type</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{u8vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{s8vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{u16vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{s16vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{u32vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{s32vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{f32vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{f64vector}}</td><td>SRFI-4 byte vector</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{thread}}</td><td>SRFI-18 thread</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{queue}}</td><td>see "data-structures" unit</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{environment}}</td><td>evaluation environment</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{time}}</td><td>SRFI-18 "time" object</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{continuation}}</td><td>continuation object</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{lock}}</td><td>lock object from "posix" unit</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{mmap}}</td><td>memory mapped file</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{condition}}</td><td>object representing exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{hash-table}}</td><td>SRFI-69 hash-table</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{tcp-listener}}</td><td>listener object from "tcp" unit</td></tr>
</table>

Additionally, some aliases are allowed:

<table>
<tr><th>Alias</th><th>Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>{{any}}</td><td>{{*}}</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{immediate}}</td><td>{{(or eof null fixnum char boolean)}}</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{port}}</td><td>{{(or input-port output-port)}}</td></tr>
<tr><td>{{void}}</td><td>{{undefined}}</td></tr>
</table>

For portability the aliases {{&optional}} and {{&rest}} are allowed
in procedure type declarations as an alternative to {{#!optional}} and
{{#!rest}}, respectively.


==== Predicates

Procedure-types of the form {{(DOM -> RNG : TYPE)}} specify that the declared
procedure will be a predicate, i.e. it accepts a single argument of type
{{DOM}}, returns a result of type {{RNG}} (usually a boolean) and returns
a true value if the argument is of type {{TYPE}} and false otherwise.


==== Purity

Procedure types are assumed to be not referentially transparent and
are assumed to possibly modify locally held state. Using the
{{(... --> ...)}} syntax, you can declare a procedure to not modify
local state, i.e. not causing any side-effects on local variables or
data contain in local variables. This gives more opportunities for
optimization but may not be violated or the results are undefined.


==== Using type information in extensions

Type information of declared toplevel variables can be used in client
code that refers to the definitions in a compiled file. The following
compiler options allow saving type-declarations to a file and consulting
the type declarations retained in this manner:

{{-emit-type-file FILENAME}} writes the type-information for all declared
definitions in an internal format to {{FILENAME}}.

{{-types FILENAME}} loads and registers the type-information in
{{FILENAME}} which should be a file generated though a previous use of
{{-emit-type-file}}.

If library code is used with {{require-extension}} or {{(declare (unit
...))}}  and a {{.types}} file of the same name exists in the
extension repository path, then it is automatically consulted. This
allows code using these libraries to take advantage of type-information
for library definitions.

Note that procedure-definitions in dynamically loaded code that was
compiled with {{-strict-types}} will not check the types of their
arguments which will result in unsafe code. Invoking such procedures
with incorrectly typed arguments will result in undefined program
behaviour.


==== Optimizations done by specialization

If argument types are known, then calls to known library procedures
are replaced with non-checking variants (if available). Additionally,
procedure checks can be omitted in cases where the value in operator
position of a procedure call is known to be a procedure. Performance
results will vary greatly depending on the nature of the compiled
code. In general, specialization will not make code that is compiled
in unsafe mode any faster: compilation in unsafe mode will omit most
type checks anyway. But specialization can often improve the
performance of code compiled in safe (default) mode.

Specializations can also be defined by the user:

===== define-specialization

<syntax>(define-specialization (NAME ARGUMENT ...) [RESULTS] BODY)</syntax>

{{NAME}} should have a declared type (for example by using {{:}})
(this is currently not checked).  Declares the calls to the globally
defined procedure {{NAME}} with arguments matching the types given in
{{ARGUMENTS}} should be replaced by {{BODY}} (a single expression). If
given, {{RESULTS}} (which follows the syntax given above under "Type
Syntax") narrows the result type(s) if it differs from the result
types previously declared for {{NAME}}.  {{ARGUMENT}} should be an
identifier naming the formal parameter or a list of the form
{{(IDENTIFIER TYPE)}}. In the former case, this argument specializes
on the {{*}} type. User-defined specializations are always local to
the compilation unit in which they occur and can not be exported. When
encountered in the interpreter, {{define-specialization}} does nothing
and returns an unspecified result.

Note that the exact order of specialization application is not
specified and nested specializations may result in not narrowing down
the result types to the most specific type, due to the way the
flow-analysis is implemented. It is recommended to not define "chains"
of specializations where one variant of a procedure call is
specialized to another one that is intended to specialize further.
This can not always be avoided, but should be kept in mind.

Note that the matching of argument types is done "exactly". This
means, for example, that an argument type specialized for {{list}}
will not match {{null}}: even though {{null}} is a subtype of {{list}}
and will match during normal flow-analysis, we want to be able to
control what happens when a procedure is called with exactly with a
list argument. To handle the case when it is called with a {{null}}
argument, define another specialization for exactly that type or
use an {{(or ...)}} type-specifier.

There is currently no way of ensuring specializations take place.  You
can use the {{-debug o}} compiler options to see the total number of
specializations performed on a particular named function call during
compilation.

===== compiler-typecase

<syntax>(compiler-typecase EXP (TYPE BODY ... [(else BODY ...)]) ...)</syntax>

Evaluates {{EXP}} and executes the first clause which names a type that
matches the type inferred during flow analysis as the result of {{EXP}}.
The result of {{EXP}} is ignored and should be a single value. If a 
{{compiler-typecase}} form occurs in evaluated code, or if it occurs in
compiled code but specialization is not enabled, then it must have
an {{else}} clause which specifies the default code to be executed
after {{EXP}}. If no {{else}} clause is given and no {{TYPE}} matches,
then a compile-time error is signalled.


==== Caveats

Assignments make flow-analysis much harder and remove opportunities
for optimization. Generally you should avoid using a lot of mutations
of both local variables and data held in local variables. It may
even make your code do unexpected things when these mutations violate
type-declarations.

Note that using threads which modify local state makes all
type-analysis pointless.
