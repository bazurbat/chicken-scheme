== Unit ports

This unit contains various extended port definitions. This unit is
used by default, unless the program is compiled with the
{{-explicit-use}} option.

=== Input/output port extensions

==== with-output-to-port

<procedure>(with-output-to-port PORT THUNK)</procedure>

Call procedure {{THUNK}} with the current output-port temporarily
bound to {{PORT}}.

==== make-input-port

<procedure>(make-input-port READ-CHAR CHAR-READY? CLOSE [PEEK-CHAR [READ-STRING! [READ-LINE]]])</procedure>

Returns a custom input port. Common operations on this port are
handled by the given parameters, which should be procedures of no
arguments.  The following arguments are all different kinds of reader
procedures:

* {{READ-CHAR}} is the most fundamental reader, and must always be
present.  It is a thunk which is called when the next character is
to be read and it should return a character or {{#!eof}}.
* {{CHAR-READY?}} is a thunk which is called when {{char-ready?}}
is called on this port and should return {{#t}} or {{#f}}.
* {{CLOSE}} is a thunk which is called when the port is closed.
* {{PEEK-CHAR}} is a thunk which is called when {{peek-char}} is
called on this port and should return a character or {{#!eof}}. If it
is not provided or {{#f}}, {{READ-CHAR}} will be used instead and the
created port object handles peeking automatically (by calling {{READ}}
and buffering the character).
* {{READ-STRING!}} is called when {{read-string!}} is called (or the
higher-level non-mutating {{read-string}}).  It will be invoked with 4
arguments: the port created by {{make-input-port}}, the number of
bytes to read, the string buffer in which to read (which may be
assumed to be big enough to hold the data) and the offset into the
string at which to put the data to read.  It should return the number
of bytes that have successfully been read, which should always be
equal to the requested bytes unless EOF was hit, in which case it can
be less.  If this procedure is not provided or {{#f}}, the buffer will
be filled by repeated reads to {{READ-CHAR}}.
* {{READ-LINE}} is called when {{read-line}} is called.  It will be
invoked with two arguments: the port created by {{make-input-port}}
and the maximum number of characters to read (or {{#f}}).  If this
procedure is not provided or {{#f}}, the buffer will be filled by
repeated reads to {{READ-CHAR}}.

All the optional procedures except for {{PEEK-CHAR}} are responsible
for updating the port's position, which currently can only be done via
low-level slot accessors like {{##sys#setslot}}; slot 4 is the row
number (ie, the line) and slot 5 is the column number (ie, the
character on the line).  If the port's positions are not updated,
{{port-position}} won't work.


==== make-output-port

<procedure>(make-output-port WRITE CLOSE [FLUSH])</procedure>

Returns a custom output port. Common operations on this port are handled
by the given parameters, which should be procedures.  {{WRITE}} is
called when output is sent to the port and receives a single argument,
a string.  {{CLOSE}} is called when the port is closed and should
be a procedure of no arguments. {{FLUSH}} (if provided) is called
for flushing the output port.


==== with-error-output-to-port

<procedure>(with-error-output-to-port PORT THUNK)</procedure>

Call procedure {{THUNK}} with the current error output-port
temporarily bound to {{PORT}}.


==== with-input-from-port

<procedure>(with-input-from-port PORT THUNK)</procedure>

Call procedure {{THUNK}} with the current input-port temporarily
bound to {{PORT}}.


=== String-port extensions

==== call-with-input-string

<procedure>(call-with-input-string STRING PROC)</procedure>

Calls the procedure {{PROC}} with a single argument that is a
string-input-port with the contents of {{STRING}}.


==== call-with-output-string

<procedure>(call-with-output-string PROC)</procedure>

Calls the procedure {{PROC}} with a single argument that is a
string-output-port.  Returns the accumulated output-string.


==== with-input-from-string

<procedure>(with-input-from-string STRING THUNK)</procedure>

Call procedure {{THUNK}} with the current input-port temporarily
bound to an input-string-port with the contents of {{STRING}}.


==== with-output-to-string

<procedure>(with-output-to-string THUNK)</procedure>

Call procedure {{THUNK}} with the current output-port temporarily
bound to a string-output-port and return the accumulated output string.


=== Port iterators

==== port-for-each

<procedure>(port-for-each FN THUNK)</procedure>

Apply {{FN}} to successive results of calling the zero argument procedure {{THUNK}} (typically {{read}}) until it returns {{#!eof}}, discarding the results.

==== port-map

<procedure>(port-map FN THUNK)</procedure>

Apply {{FN}} to successive results of calling the zero argument procedure {{THUNK}} (typically {{read}}) until it returns {{#!eof}}, returning a list of the collected results.

==== port-fold

<procedure>(port-fold FN ACC THUNK)</procedure>

Apply {{FN}} to successive results of calling the zero argument procedure {{THUNK}}, (typically {{read}}) passing the {{ACC}} value as the second argument. The {{FN}} result becomes the new {{ACC}} value. When {{THUNK}} returns {{#!eof}}, the last {{FN}} result is returned.

==== copy-port

<procedure>(copy-port FROM TO [READ [WRITE]])</procedure>

Reads all remaining data from port {{FROM}} using the reader procedure
{{READ}} and writes it to port {{TO}} using the writer procedure
{{WRITE}}. {{READ}} defaults to {{read-char}} and {{WRITE}} to
{{write-char}}. Note that this procedure does not check {{FROM}} and
{{TO}} for being ports, so the reader and writer procedures may
perform arbitrary operations as long as they can be invoked
as {{(READ FROM)}} and {{(WRITE X TO)}}, respectively.
{{copy-port}} returns an undefined value.

{{copy-port}} was introduced in Chicken 4.6.0.

=== Funky ports

==== make-broadcast-port

<procedure>(make-broadcast-port PORT ...)</procedure>

Returns a custom output port that emits everything written into it to
the ports given as {{PORT ...}}. Closing the broadcast port does not close
any of the argument ports.

==== make-concatenated-port

<procedure>(make-concatenated-port PORT1 PORT2 ...)</procedure>

Returns a custom input port that reads its input from {{PORT1}}, until it
is empty, then from {{PORT2}} and so on. Closing the concatenated port
does not close any of the argument ports.
