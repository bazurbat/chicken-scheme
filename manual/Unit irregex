== Unit irregex

This library unit provides support for regular expressions, using the
powerful ''irregex'' regular expression engine by Alex Shinn.  It
supports both POSIX syntax with various (irregular) PCRE extensions,
as well as SCSH's SRE syntax, with various aliases for commonly used
patterns.  DFA matching is used when possible, otherwise a
closure-compiled NFA approach is used.  Matching may be performed over
standard Scheme strings, or over arbitrarily chunked streams of
strings.

On systems that support dynamic loading, the {{irregex}} unit can
be made available in the CHICKEN interpreter ({{csi}}) by entering

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(require-extension irregex)
</enscript>

=== Specification

==== Procedures

===== irregex
===== string->irregex
===== sre->irregex

<procedure>(irregex <posix-string-or-sre> [<options> ...])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(string->irregex <posix-string> [<options> ...])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(sre->irregex <sre> [<options> ...])</procedure><br>

Compiles a regular expression from either a POSIX-style regular
expression string (with most PCRE extensions) or an SCSH-style SRE.
There is no {{(rx ...)}} syntax - just use normal Scheme lists, with
{{quasiquote}} if you like.

Technically a string by itself could be considered a valid (though
rather silly) SRE, so if you want to just match a literal string you
should use something like {{(irregex `(: ,str))}}, or use the explicit
{{(sre->irregex str)}}.

The options are a list of any of the following symbols:

; {{'i}}, {{'case-insensitive}} : match case-insensitively
; {{'m}}, {{'multi-line}} : treat string as multiple lines (effects {{^}} and {{$}})
; {{'s}}, {{'single-line}} : treat string as a single line ({{.}} can match newline)
; {{'utf8}} : utf8-mode (assumes strings are byte-strings)
; {{'fast}} : try to optimize the regular expression
; {{'small}} : try to compile a smaller regular expression
; {{'backtrack}} : enforce a backtracking implementation

The {{'fast}} and {{'small}} options are heuristic guidelines and will
not necessarily make the compiled expression faster or smaller.

===== string->sre
===== maybe-string->sre

<procedure>(string->sre <str>)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(maybe-string->sre <obj>)</procedure><br>

For backwards compatibility, procedures to convert a POSIX string into
an SRE.

{{maybe-string->sre}} does the same thing, but only if the argument is
a string, otherwise it assumes {{<obj>}} is an SRE and returns it
as-is.  This is useful when you want to provide an API that allows
either a POSIX string or SRE (like {{irregex}} or {{irregex-search}}
below) - it ensures the result is an SRE.

===== irregex?

<procedure>(irregex? <obj>)</procedure><br>

Returns {{#t}} iff the object is a regular expression.

===== irregex-search

<procedure>(irregex-search <irx> <str> [<start> <end>])</procedure>

Searches for any instances of the pattern {{<irx>}} (a POSIX string, SRE
sexp, or pre-compiled regular expression) in {{<str>}}, optionally between
the given range.  If a match is found, returns a match object,
otherwise returns {{#f}}.

Match objects can be used to query the original range of the string or
its submatches using the {{irregex-match-*}} procedures below.

Examples:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search "foobar" "abcFOOBARdef") => #f

(irregex-search (irregex "foobar" 'i) "abcFOOBARdef") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(w/nocase "foobar") "abcFOOBARdef") => #<match>
</enscript>

Note, the actual match result is represented by a vector in the
default implementation.  Throughout this manual, we'll just write
{{#<match>}} to show that a successful match was returned when the
details are not important.

Matching follows the POSIX leftmost, longest semantics, when
searching.  That is, of all possible matches in the string,
{{irregex-search}} will return the match at the first position
(leftmost).  If multiple matches are possible from that same first
position, the longest match is returned.

===== irregex-match

<procedure>(irregex-match <irx> <str> [<start> <end>])</procedure>

Like {{irregex-search}}, but performs an anchored match against the
beginning and end of the substring specified by {{<start>}} and {{<end>}},
without searching.

Examples:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-match '(w/nocase "foobar") "abcFOOBARdef") => #f

(irregex-match '(w/nocase "foobar") "FOOBAR") => #<match>
</enscript>

===== irregex-match-data?

<procedure>(irregex-match-data? <obj>)</procedure>

Returns {{#t}} iff the object is a successful match result from
{{irregex-search}} or {{irregex-match}}.

===== irregex-num-submatches
===== irregex-match-num-submatches

<procedure>(irregex-num-submatches <irx>)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-match-num-submatches <match>)</procedure>

Returns the number of numbered submatches that are defined in the
irregex or match object.

===== irregex-names
===== irregex-match-names

<procedure>(irregex-names <irx>)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-match-names <match>)</procedure>

Returns an association list of named submatches that are defined in
the irregex or match object.  The {{car}} of each item in this list is
the name of a submatch, the {{cdr}} of each item is the numerical
submatch corresponding to this name.  If a named submatch occurs
multiple times in the irregex, it will also occur multiple times in
this list.

===== irregex-match-valid-index?

<procedure>(irregex-match-valid-index? <match> <index-or-name>)</procedure><br>

Returns {{#t}} iff the {{index-or-name}} named submatch or index is
defined in the {{match}} object.

===== irregex-match-substring
===== irregex-match-start-index
===== irregex-match-end-index

<procedure>(irregex-match-substring <match> [<index-or-name>])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-match-start-index <match> [<index-or-name>])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-match-end-index <match> [<index-or-name>])</procedure>

Fetches the matched substring (or its start or end offset) at the
given submatch index, or named submatch.  The entire match is index 0,
the first 1, etc.  The default is index 0.

===== irregex-match-subchunk

<procedure>(irregex-match-subchunk <match> [<index-or-name>])</procedure>

Generates a chunked data-type for the given match item, of the same
type as the underlying chunk type (see Chunked String Matching below).
This is only available if the chunk type specifies the get-subchunk
API, otherwise an error is raised.

===== irregex-replace
===== irregex-replace/all

<procedure>(irregex-replace <irx> <str> [<replacements> ...])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-replace/all <irx> <str> [<replacements> ...])</procedure>

Matches a pattern in a string, and replaces it with a (possibly empty)
list of substitutions.  Each {{<replacement>}} can be either a string
literal, a numeric index, a symbol (as a named submatch), or a
procedure which takes one argument (the match object) and returns a
string.

Examples:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-replace "[aeiou]" "hello world" "*") => "h*llo world"

(irregex-replace/all "[aeiou]" "hello world" "*") => "h*ll* w*rld"
</enscript>

===== irregex-split
===== irregex-extract

<procedure>(irregex-split <irx> <str> [<start> <end>])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-extract <irx> <str> [<start> <end>])</procedure>

{{irregex-split}} splits the string {{<str>}} into substrings divided
by the pattern in {{<irx>}}.  {{irregex-extract}} does the opposite,
returning a list of each instance of the pattern matched disregarding
the substrings in between.

===== irregex-fold

<procedure>(irregex-fold <irx> <kons> <knil> <str> [<finish> <start> <end>])</procedure>

This performs a fold operation over every non-overlapping place
{{<irx>}} occurs in the string {{str}}.

The {{<kons>}} procedure takes the following signature:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(<kons> <from-index> <match> <seed>)
</enscript>

where {{<from-index>}} is the index from where we started searching
(initially {{<start>}} and thereafter the end index of the last
match), {{<match>}} is the resulting match-data object, and {{<seed>}}
is the accumulated fold result starting with {{<knil>}}.

The rationale for providing the {{<from-index>}} (which is not
provided in the SCSH {{regexp-fold}} utility), is because this
information is useful (e.g. for extracting the unmatched portion of
the string before the current match, as needed in
{{irregex-replace}}), and not otherwise directly accessible.

The optional {{<finish>}} takes two arguments:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(<finish> <from-index> <seed>)
</enscript>

which simiarly allows you to pick up the unmatched tail of the string,
and defaults to just returning the {{<seed>}}.

{{<start>}} and {{<end>}} are numeric indices letting you specify the
boundaries of the string on which you want to fold.

To extract all instances of a match out of a string, you can use

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(map irregex-match-substring
     (irregex-fold <irx>
                   (lambda (i m s) (cons m s))
		   '()
		   <str>
		   (lambda (i s) (reverse s))))
</enscript>

==== Extended SRE Syntax

Irregex provides the first native implementation of SREs (Scheme
Regular Expressions), and includes many extensions necessary both for
minimal POSIX compatibility, as well as for modern extensions found in
libraries such as PCRE.

The following table summarizes the SRE syntax, with detailed
explanations following.

  ;; basic patterns
  <string>                          ; literal string
  (seq <sre> ...)                   ; sequence

  ;; optional/multiple patterns
  (? <sre> ...)                     ; 0 or 1 matches
  (* <sre> ...)                     ; 0 or more matches
  (+ <sre> ...)                     ; 1 or more matches
  (= <n> <sre> ...)                 ; exactly <n> matches
  (>= <n> <sre> ...)                ; <n> or more matches
  (** <from> <to> <sre> ...)        ; <n> to <m> matches
  (?? <sre> ...)                    ; non-greedy (non-greedy) pattern: (0 or 1)
  (*? <sre> ...)                    ; non-greedy kleene star

  (backref <n-or-name>)             ; match a previous submatch
  
  ;; toggling case-sensitivity
  (w/case <sre> ...)                ; enclosed <sre>s are case-sensitive

  ;; backwards compatibility
  (posix-string <string>)           ; embed a POSIX string literal

===== Basic SRE Patterns

The simplest SRE is a literal string, which matches that string
exactly.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search "needle" "hayneedlehay") => #<match>
</enscript>

By default the match is case-sensitive, though you can control this
either with the compiler flags or local overrides:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search "needle" "haynEEdlehay") => #f

(irregex-search (irregex "needle" 'i) "haynEEdlehay") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(w/nocase "needle") "haynEEdlehay") => #<match>
</enscript>

You can use {{w/case}} to switch back to case-sensitivity inside a
{{w/nocase}} or when the SRE was compiled with {{'i}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(w/nocase "SMALL" (w/case "BIG")) "smallBIGsmall") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(w/nocase "small" (w/case "big")) "smallBIGsmall") => #f
</enscript>

''Important:'' characters outside the ASCII range (ie, UTF8 chars) are
'''not''' matched case insensitively!

Of course, literal strings by themselves aren't very interesting
regular expressions, so we want to be able to compose them.  The most
basic way to do this is with the {{seq}} operator (or its abbreviation
{{:}}), which matches one or more patterns consecutively:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "one" space "two" space "three") "one two three") => #<match>
</enscript>

As you may have noticed above, the {{w/case}} and {{w/nocase}}
operators allowed multiple SREs in a sequence - other operators that
take any number of arguments (e.g. the repetition operators below)
allow such implicit sequences.

To match any one of a set of patterns use the {{or}} alternation
operator:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(or "eeney" "meeney" "miney") "meeney") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(or "eeney" "meeney" "miney") "moe") => #f
</enscript>

===== SRE Repetition Patterns

There are also several ways to control the number of times a pattern
is matched.  The simplest of these is {{?}} which just optionally
matches the pattern:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "matches!") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "match!") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "matche!") => #f
</enscript>

To optionally match any number of times, use {{*}}, the Kleene star:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<html") => #f
</enscript>

Often you want to match any number of times, but at least one time is
required, and for that you use {{+}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<a>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<>") => #f
</enscript>

More generally, to match at least a given number of times, use {{>=}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<table>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<pre>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<tr>") => #f
</enscript>

To match a specific number of times exactly, use {{=}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "<" (= 4 (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "<" (= 4 (~ #\>)) ">") "<table>") => #f
</enscript>

And finally, the most general form is {{**}} which specifies a range
of times to match.  All of the earlier forms are special cases of this.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: (= 3 (** 1 3 numeric) ".") (** 1 3 numeric)) "192.168.1.10") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: (= 3 (** 1 3 numeric) ".") (** 1 3 numeric)) "192.0168.1.10") => #f
</enscript>

There are also so-called "non-greedy" variants of these repetition
operators, by convention suffixed with an additional {{?}}.  Since the
normal repetition patterns can match any of the allotted repetition
range, these operators will match a string if and only if the normal
versions matched.  However, when the endpoints of which submatch
matched where are taken into account (specifically, all matches when
using irregex-search since the endpoints of the match itself matter),
the use of a non-greedy repetition can change the result.

So, whereas {{?}} can be thought to mean "match or don't match,"
{{??}} means "don't match or match."  {{*}} typically consumes as much
as possible, but {{*?}} tries first to match zero times, and only
consumes one at a time if that fails.  If you have a greedy operator
followed by a non-greedy operator in the same pattern, they can
produce surprisins results as they compete to make the match longer or
shorter.  If this seems confusing, that's because it is.  Non-greedy
repetitions are defined only in terms of the specific backtracking
algorithm used to implement them, which for compatibility purposes
always means the Perl algorithm.  Thus, when using these patterns you
force IrRegex to use a backtracking engine, and can't rely on
efficient execution.

===== SRE Character Sets

Perhaps more common than matching specific strings is matching any of
a set of characters.  You can use the {{or}} alternation pattern on a
list of single-character strings to simulate a character set, but this
is too clumsy for everyday use so SRE syntax allows a number of
shortcuts.

A single character matches that character literally, a trivial
character class.  More conveniently, a list holding a single element
which is a string refers to the character set composed of every
character in the string.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-match '(* #\-) "---") => #<match>

(irregex-match '(* #\-) "-_-") => #f

(irregex-match '(* ("aeiou")) "oui") => #<match>

(irregex-match '(* ("aeiou")) "ouais") => #f
</enscript>

Ranges are introduced with the {{/}} operator.  Any strings or
characters in the {{/}} are flattened and then taken in pairs to
represent the start and end points, inclusive, of character ranges.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-match '(* (/ "AZ09")) "R2D2") => #<match>

(irregex-match '(* (/ "AZ09")) "C-3PO") => #f
</enscript>

In addition, a number of set algebra operations are provided.  {{or}},
of course, has the same meaning, but when all the options are
character sets it can be thought of as the set union operator.  This
is further extended by the {{&}} set intersection, {{-}} set
difference, and {{~}} set complement operators.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-match '(* (& (/ "az") (~ ("aeiou")))) "xyzzy") => #<match>

(irregex-match '(* (& (/ "az") (~ ("aeiou")))) "vowels") => #f

(irregex-match '(* (- (/ "az") ("aeiou"))) "xyzzy") => #<match>

(irregex-match '(* (- (/ "az") ("aeiou"))) "vowels") => #f
</enscript>

===== SRE Assertion Patterns

There are a number of times it can be useful to assert something about
the area around a pattern without explicitly making it part of the
pattern.  The most common cases are specifically anchoring some
pattern to the beginning or end of a word or line or even the whole
string.  For example, to match on the end of a word:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "foo" eow) "foo") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "foo" eow) "foo!") => #<match>

(irregex-search '(: "foo" eow) "foof") => #f
</enscript>

The {{bow}}, {{bol}}, {{eol}}, {{bos}} and {{eos}} work similarly.
{{nwb}} asserts that you are not in a word-boundary - if replaced for
{{eow}} in the above examples it would reverse all the results.

There is no {{wb}}, since you tend to know from context whether it
would be the beginning or end of a word, but if you need it you can
always use {{(or bow eow)}}.

Somewhat more generally, Perl introduced positive and negative
look-ahead and look-behind patterns.  Perl look-behind patterns are
limited to a fixed length, however the IrRegex versions have no such
limit.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(irregex-search '(: "regular" (look-ahead " expression"))
                "regular expression")
 => #<match>
</enscript>

The most general case, of course, would be an {{and}} pattern to
complement the {{or}} pattern - all the patterns must match or the
whole pattern fails.  This may be provided in a future release,
although it (and look-ahead and look-behind assertions) are unlikely
to be compiled efficiently.

===== SRE Utility Patterns

The following utility regular expressions are also provided for common
patterns that people are eternally reinventing.  They are not
necessarily the official patterns matching the RFC definitions of the
given data, because of the way that such patterns tend to be used.
There are three general usages for regexps:

; searching : search for a pattern matching a desired object in a larger text

; validation : determine whether an entire string matches a pattern

; extraction : given a string already known to be valid, extract certain fields from it as submatches

In some cases, but not always, these will overlap.  When they are
different, {{irregex-search}} will naturally always want the searching
version, so IrRegex provides that version.

As an example where these might be different, consider a URL.  If you
want to match all the URLs in some arbitrary text, you probably want
to exclude a period or comma at the tail end of a URL, since it's more
likely being used as punctuation rather than part of the URL, despite
the fact that it would be valid URL syntax.

Another problem with the RFC definitions is the standard itself may
have become irrelevant.  For example, the pattern IrRegex provides for
email addresses doesn't match quoted local parts (e.g.
{{"first last"@domain.com}}) because these are increasingly rare, and
unsupported by enough software that it's better to discourage their use.
Conversely, technically consecutive periods
(e.g. {{first..last@domain.com}}) are not allowed in email addresses, but
most email software does allow this, and in fact such addresses are
quite common in Japan.

The current patterns provided are:

  newline                        ; general newline pattern (crlf, cr, lf)
  integer                        ; an integer
  real                           ; a real number (including scientific)
  string                         ; a "quoted" string
  symbol                         ; an R5RS Scheme symbol
  ipv4-address                   ; a numeric decimal ipv4 address
  ipv6-address                   ; a numeric hexadecimal ipv6 address
  domain                         ; a domain name
  email                          ; an email address
  http-url                       ; a URL beginning with https?://

Because of these issues the exact definitions of these patterns are
subject to be changed, but will be documented clearly when they are
finalized.  More common patterns are also planned, but as what you
want increases in complexity it's probably better to use a real
parser.

==== Supported PCRE Syntax

Since the PCRE syntax is so overwhelming complex, it's easier to just
list what we *don't* support for now.  Refer to the
[[http://pcre.org/pcre.txt|PCRE documentation]] for details.  You
should be using the SRE syntax anyway!

Unicode character classes ({{\P}}) are not supported, but will be
in an upcoming release.  {{\C}} named characters are not supported.

Callbacks, subroutine patterns and recursive patterns are not
supported.  ({{*FOO}}) patterns are not supported and may never be.

{{\G}} and {{\K}} are not supported.

Octal character escapes are not supported because they are ambiguous
with back-references - just use hex character escapes.

Other than that everything should work, including named submatches,
zero-width assertions, conditional patterns, etc.

In addition, {{\<}} and {{\>}} act as beginning-of-word and end-of-word
marks, respectively, as in Emacs regular expressions.

Also, two escapes are provided to embed SRE patterns inside PCRE
strings, {{"\'<sre>"}} and {{"(*'<sre>)"}}.  For example, to match a
comma-delimited list of integers you could use

<enscript highlight=scheme>
"\\'integer(,\\'integer)*"
</enscript>

and to match a URL in angle brackets you could use

<enscript highlight=scheme>
"<('*http-url)>"
</enscript>

Note in the second example the enclosing {{"('*...)"}} syntax is needed
because the Scheme reader would consider the closing {{">"}} as part of
the SRE symbol.

The following chart gives a quick reference from PCRE form to the SRE
equivalent:

  ;; basic syntax

==== Chunked String Matching

It's often desirable to perform regular expression matching over
sequences of characters not represented as a single string.  The most
obvious example is a text-buffer data structure, but you may also want
to match over lists or trees of strings (i.e. ropes), over only
certain ranges within a string, over an input port, etc.  With
existing regular expression libraries, the only way to accomplish this
is by converting the abstract sequence into a freshly allocated
string.  This can be expensive, or even impossible if the object is a
text-buffer opened onto a 500MB file.

IrRegex provides a chunked string API specifically for this purpose.
You define a chunking API with {{make-irregex-chunker}}:

===== make-irregex-chunker

<procedure>(make-irregex-chunker <get-next> <get-string> [<get-start> <get-end> <get-substring> <get-subchunk>])</procedure>

where 

{{(<get-next> chunk) => }} returns the next chunk, or {{#f}} if there are no more chunks

{{(<get-string> chunk) => }} a string source for the chunk

{{(<get-start> chunk) => }} the start index of the result of {{<get-string>}} (defaults to always 0)

{{(<get-end> chunk) => }} the end (exclusive) of the string (defaults to {{string-length}} of the source string)

{{(<get-substring> cnk1 i cnk2 j) => }} a substring for the range between the chunk {{cnk1}} starting at index {{i}} and ending at {{cnk2}} at index {{j}}

{{(<get-subchunk> cnk1 i cnk2 j) => }} as above but returns a new chunked data type instead of a string (optional)

There are two important constraints on the {{<get-next>}} procedure.
It must return an {{eq?}} identical object when called multiple times
on the same chunk, and it must not return a chunk with an empty string
(start == end).  This second constraint is for performance reasons -
we push the work of possibly filtering empty chunks to the chunker
since there are many chunk types for which empty strings aren't
possible, and this work is thus not needed.  Note that the initial
chunk passed to match on is allowed to be empty.

{{<get-substring>}} is provided for possible performance improvements
- without it a default is used.  {{<get-subchunk>}} is optional -
without it you may not use {{irregex-match-subchunk}} described above.

You can then match chunks of these types with the following
procedures:

===== irregex-search/chunked
===== irregex-match/chunked

<procedure>(irregex-search/chunked <irx> <chunker> <chunk> [<start>])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(irregex-match/chunked <irx> <chunker> <chunk> [<start>])</procedure>

These return normal match-data objects.

Example:

To match against a simple, flat list of strings use:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
  (define (rope->string rope1 start rope2 end)
    (if (eq? rope1 rope2)
        (substring (car rope1) start end)
        (let loop ((rope (cdr rope1))
                   (res (list (substring (car rope1) start))))
           (if (eq? rope rope2)
               (string-concatenate-reverse      ; from SRFI-13
                (cons (substring (car rope) 0 end) res))
               (loop (cdr rope) (cons (car rope) res))))))

  (define rope-chunker
    (make-irregex-chunker (lambda (x) (and (pair? (cdr x)) (cdr x)))
                          car
                          (lambda (x) 0)
                          (lambda (x) (string-length (car x)))
                          rope->string))

  (irregex-search/chunked <pat> rope-chunker <list-of-strings>)
</enscript>

Here we are just using the default start, end and substring behaviors,
so the above chunker could simply be defined as:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
  (define rope-chunker
    (make-irregex-chunker (lambda (x) (and (pair? (cdr x)) (cdr x))) car))
</enscript>

===== irregex-fold/chunked

<procedure>(irregex-fold/chunked <irx> <kons> <knil> <chunker> <chunk> [<finish> [<start-index>]])</procedure>

Chunked version of {{irregex-fold}}.

==== Utilities

The following procedures are also available.

===== irregex-quote

<procedure>(irregex-quote <str>)</procedure>

Returns a new string with any special regular expression characters
escaped, to match the original string literally in POSIX regular
expressions.

===== irregex-opt

<procedure>(irregex-opt <list-of-strings>)</procedure>

Returns an optimized SRE matching any of the literal strings
in the list, like Emacs' {{regexp-opt}}.  Note this optimization
doesn't help when irregex is able to build a DFA.

===== sre->string

<procedure>(sre->string <sre>)</procedure>

Convert an SRE to a POSIX-style regular expression string, if
possible.
